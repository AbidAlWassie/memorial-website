# Frontend Rules

## Overview

These rules guide our frontend development to ensure simplicity, readability, and maintainability.

### 1. **Use Tailwind CSS for Styling**

- **Maximize Tailwind CSS:** Use Tailwind CSS for all styling tasks as much as possible.
  - **Fallback to CSS:** Only use standard CSS if something cannot be achieved with Tailwind.

### 2. **Keep It Simple**

- **Avoid Overcomplication:** Do not overcomplicate the codebase with so-called best practices. Prioritize simplicity.

### 3. **Use Prettier Formatter**

- **Prettier:** Use Prettier Vscode extention for formatting everything.
  - use "_prettier-plugin-tailwindcss_" vscode plugin for formatting tailwind utility classes.

### 3. **Consistency Over Perfection**

- **Consistent Style:** Aim for a consistent coding style across the project. Consistent, slightly imperfect code is better than perfect but inconsistent patterns.
