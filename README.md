# Frontend Rules

## Overview
These rules guide our frontend development to ensure simplicity, readability, and maintainability.

### 1. **Use Tailwind CSS for Styling**
- **Maximize Tailwind CSS:** Use Tailwind CSS for all styling tasks as much as possible.
  - **Fallback to CSS:** Only use standard CSS if something cannot be achieved with Tailwind.
  
### 2. **Keep It Simple**
- **Avoid Overcomplication:** Do not overcomplicate the codebase with so-called best practices. Prioritize simplicity.

### 3. **Consistency Over Perfection**
- **Consistent Style:** Aim for a consistent coding style across the project. Consistent, slightly imperfect code is better than perfect but inconsistent patterns.
